 <h1>Ranking series I have watched</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 series of all time</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Friends</h3>
 <p>Friends is one of my favorite sitcoms of all time. It's funny, emotional at times and great characters. I love it.</p>
 <h3>Modern Family</h3>
 <p>It is related to family with 3 families in them. It;s a really fun show and also shows the stereotypes in a society in a comic manner.
 </p>
 <h3>Big Bang Theory</h3>
 <p>Its is about 4 friends in a science field who are interpreted as "nerds" who then eventually find their partners. This is also a very fun show I would like to recommend</p>
